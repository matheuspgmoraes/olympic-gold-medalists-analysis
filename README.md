# Olympic Gold Medalists Analysis

This code, developed in R, takes a dataset on the Olympic Games and analyzes some interesting information about the gold medalists in the Summer Olympic Games. The analysis consists in looking the average height and ages of the gold medalists over the years. As it is known that the games are separated into women and men competitions, so is the analysis.   

Taking a look at the average heights in women we can see that the collective sports had a great in increase, specially in volleyball, where the average gold medalists height went from 170cm to almost 190cm. 

It's interesting to see that on both women and men average heights, the lower ones are on individual sports and higher on collective ones.
